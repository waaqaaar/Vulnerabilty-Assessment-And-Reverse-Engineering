                                               `**Vulnerability Assessment and Reverse Engineering Lab Guides**

**Overview**

This course is designed to provide hands-on experience in identifying, analyzing, and exploiting security vulnerabilities in software and web applications. It covers vulnerability assessment methodologies, reverse engineering techniques, and practical exploitation using ethical hacking tools. The objective is to build a strong foundation in penetration testing, malware analysis, and secure coding practices.

Prerequisites

Before starting this course, students should have:

Basic knowledge of cybersecurity concepts

Familiarity with Linux command line

Understanding of programming languages (Python, C, or Assembly is a plus)

Knowledge of web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, SQL)

**Tools and Software**

The following tools will be used throughout the lab:

Operating Systems: Kali Linux, Windows (for reversing challenges)

Reverse Engineering Tools: Ghidra, IDA Free, Radare2, x64dbg, OllyDbg

Web Application Security Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLMap, Nikto

Exploitation Frameworks: Metasploit, ExploitDB, Immunity Debugger

Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools: Binwalk, Strings, PE Studio, GDB

Virtualization Platforms: VirtualBox or VMware for lab environments

**Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Conduct vulnerability assessments on web applications and binaries

Perform static and dynamic analysis of malware and executable files

Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, Buffer Overflow

Understand reverse engineering methodologies and bypass protections

Utilize ethical hacking tools for penetration testing and debugging

Develop secure coding practices to mitigate vulnerabilities

**Lab Structure**

The lab is divided into the following modules:

Introduction to Vulnerability Assessment

Understanding CVEs and security advisories

Using OpenVAS and Nessus for scanning

Web Application Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, IDOR

Manual testing vs automated tools

Reverse Engineering Fundamentals

Disassembly and decompilation basics

Analyzing Windows PE and Linux ELF files

Exploitation and Debugging

Buffer Overflow exploitation

Shellcode injection and mitigation bypass

Malware Analysis

Static and dynamic analysis of malware samples

Behavior analysis using sandboxes

Advanced Topics

Obfuscation techniques and anti-debugging tricks

Binary patching and CTF-style challenges

**Lab Guidelines**

Use ethical hacking techniques responsibly. Testing must be conducted in a controlled environment.

Always seek permission before testing any real-world system.

Follow responsible disclosure practices for vulnerabilities.

Document findings and remediation steps for each lab exercise.
